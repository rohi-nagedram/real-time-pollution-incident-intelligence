This project demonstrates a real-time pollution incident intelligence system
focused on Delhi PM2.5 levels.

Pollution readings are processed as a continuous stream, and simple,
explainable logic is applied to detect unsafe air quality conditions instantly.

The system prioritizes clarity, real-time decision-making, and reliability,
using simulated data to avoid external dependencies during evaluation.
